# Random Stuff

Below is a selection of projects I have developed, showcasing my skills in web development, game design, and artificial intelligence.

### 1. Boids Simulation
- **Description**: Developed a flocking simulation based on the principles of Separation, Cohesion, and Alignment. Each boid has a distinct face, adding a unique visual element to the simulation.
- **Technologies Used**: HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript
- **Key Features**: Implementation of flocking algorithms, visual representation of individual boids.

### 2. LegalWebsite
- **Description**: Created a website to explain various legal laws as part of a 6th form project. This was my first comprehensive web development project, and it provided a strong foundation in web technologies.
- **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Key Features**: Informative content presentation, user-friendly interface.

### 3. Genetic AI
- **Description**: Designed a project to understand and implement a genetic algorithm. 
- **Technologies Used**: HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript
- **Key Features**: Basic implementation of genetic algorithms, visualization of AI learning process.

### 4. Snake Game
- **Description**: Recreated the classic snake game within four hours, without relying on any guides or tutorials.
- **Technologies Used**: HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript
- **Key Features**: Classic gameplay mechanics, responsive design.

### 5. Tic Tac Toe
- **Description**: Developed a web-based tic-tac-toe game where players can compete against a simple AI that makes random moves.
- **Technologies Used**: HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript
- **Key Features**: Basic AI opponent, interactive user interface.

### 6. Snake Bot
- **Description**: Following the creation of my snake game, I decided to add a bot into the game that would follow a hamiltonian cycle continuously until the game was completed
- **Technologies Used**: HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript
- **Key Features**: Hamiltonian Cycle, Simple path finding algorithm.

### 7. Fractals
- **Description**: Created a visual representation of fractals, including a Julia set where the parameter z<sub>0</sub> is determined by the mouse pointer's position. Also developed a Mandelbrot set in high detail.
- **Technologies Used**: HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript
- **Key Features**: Interactive Julia set manipulation via mouse pointer, detailed rendering of the Mandelbrot set.

### 8. XOR problem
- **Description**: Created a neural network capable of backpropagation and solved the XOR proble, using it
- **Technologies Used**: HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript
- **Key Features**: Neural networks and backpropagation
